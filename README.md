# Setting up the connection.php File
To connect to the database in your system, you'll need to create a connection.php file with your system-specific configuration. Here's how to do it:

1.	Clone the Repository: First, clone this repository to your local machine by running the following command:

bash
Copy code
```
 git clone https://github.com/hetsheth40/student_records
```

2. Navigate to the Project Directory: Change your working directory to the project folder:

bash
Copy code
```
cd your-repo
```

3. Create the connection.php File: In the project directory, create a new connection.php file if it doesn't already exist. You can do this with a text editor or command line. For example, using a text editor:

bash
Copy code
```
touch connection.php
```

4. Edit connection.php: Open the connection.php file in a text editor and add the following code, replacing the placeholders with your database information:

php
Copy code
```
<?php
// Replace with your database connection details
$host = 'your_hostname';
$username = 'your_username';
$password = 'your_password';
$database = 'your_database_name';

?>
```

Replace 'your_hostname' with the hostname of your database server.
Replace 'your_username' with your database username.
Replace 'your_password' with your database password.
Replace 'your_database_name' with the name of your database.


5. Save the connection.php File: Save your changes in the connection.php file.

6. Add connection.php to .gitignore: To avoid accidentally sharing sensitive information, make sure to add connection.php to your project's .gitignore file. If you don't have a .gitignore file, you can create one. Open it and add the following line:

Copy code
```
connection.php
```

This will prevent the connection.php file from being committed to your GitHub repository.

7. Test the Connection: Run your application and check if it can connect to the database using the newly created connection.php file.

By following these steps, you can set up the connection.php file with your database configuration securely and keep sensitive information out of your GitHub repository. Remember to provide clear instructions and placeholders for users to replace with their own database details.
